- I’m using bun to manage packages.
- Don’t create a summary document.
- Running all the tests with `bun run test` is cheap, so do it all the time. Don’t do too much before running tests.
- Try to maintain 100% test coverage. Use `bun run test --coverage`.
- I’m using `jj` so you can use that to look at your diff, but please don’t commit unless I ask you to.
- Make sure you leave things in a good state. No diagnostics warnings. No type errors.
- We use tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment
- Never say “you’re absolutely right”
